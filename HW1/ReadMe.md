|<b>Map3: Illegal Firework to 311 Complaints percentage</b>|


## Data Representation
The first map shows the magnitude of 311 complaints in different zip codes in New York City. The dark blue sections on the map shows that there are a lot of 311 complaints in Brooklyn, Bronx and parts of Manhattan. The lighter blue sections in the zip codes in Staten island shows that this borough has the least 311 complaint. 

The third map shows that Staten island has the highest percentage of its 311 complaints being illegal fireworks despite having the lowest number of 311 complaints out of all the boroughs.

Using graduated color map to represent this data helps to visualize and get a high level understanding of the data without getting distracted by the specific numbers. 

## Improving Data Visualization
One way to improve the data visualization to make it more accurate and insightful is by narrowing the class range. This will add more resolution to the data representation.
