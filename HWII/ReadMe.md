# Assignment II

In this assignment, I retrieved data, conducted analysis, visualized and interpreted the results of my analysis.

## Process

* Downloaded 311 service request data from NYC Open Data Portal
* Filtered for Manhattan
* Used Analysis Tool to count points in polygon
* Used points count to create a gradient map
* Visualized map with
     * Noise from Ice Cream truck
     * Noise from Construction
     * Noise from Animals
     * Noise from loud music and parties
* Downloaded Residential zoning data from NYC Open Data Portal to enhance data insight
* Filtered Residential zoning data for Manhattan only
* Overlayed Residential zoning map over 311 gradient map

## Interpretation 

From the Noise complaints map, it is obvious the most common noise complaints are noises from loud music and parties. Also, looking at the Gradient map, it is obvious that places like the financial district, or Central Park for example have very low 311 complaint density. In order to better analyze and understand this trend, I decided to check residential zoning in Manhattan. 

The map from the Residential zoning data shows that areas with high 311 complaint density are located in highly populated residential zones. This can explain why the highest noise complaint is related to loud music and parties. It also explains why commercial and public parks and spaces have less complaints.
